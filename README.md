# The Tech Academy Basic C-Sharp Projects

This repository contains the coding projects completed during the Tech Academy's Basic C# course. Each project is aimed at helping me develop a strong foundation in C# programming, covering various essential concepts and techniques. 

As I progress through the coursework, this repository will be regularly updated to reflect the changes and improvements made to the projects.
